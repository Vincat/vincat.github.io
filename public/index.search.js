For the home user with modest requirements, i.e less than 4 users at most, then not much more than what is displayed in the image is all you will need.\nI have 3 HPEliteDesktops, and a bunch of Raspberry PIâ€™s, not all running at the same time. Due to my experimental nature, there are about 3 running constantly, the others are for experimentation purposes.\nThe cost of the HP EliteDesktop are at thie time of writing (late 2023) is about $140 AU off Ebay. The Raspberry Piâ€™s I buy new, I have a few Pi3, 4 and one 5.\nWhat services do I run?

After the initial install is done, then I move the server to the server closet and connect a wired Ethernet cable to provide Internet connectivity.\npasswd vincent Changing password for vincent.

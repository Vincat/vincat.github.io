      <description>What is Docker and why use it? Docker is a popular platform for developing, distributing and running applications. It works by using containerization, a lightweight form of virtualization.
Think of a container like a shipping container for software: it can be moved from computer to computer with all it&amp;rsquo;s contents secure. A container includes everything an application needs to run - all its libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. This means that you can be assured the application will run an computer regardless of any operating system.</description>

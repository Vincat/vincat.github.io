This site will be my public notes and examples of config files for running a Homelab, also on Linux commands.  

While everything here will be based around Ubuntu, Server and Desktop, most commands will be relevant to other Debian based Linux's.  
In the mix is my Raspberry Pi's, which my be running Raspbian, based on Debian.  

Please use the menu on the left to have a look around.

## What is here?

![Servers](/images/server1.jpg)  

This site will contain my notes and configuration files on my home lab.  
As you can see it is not some powerful, power hungry set up. For the home user with modest requirements, i.e less than 4 users at most, then not much more than what is displayed in the image is all you will need.  
I have 3 HPEliteDesktops, and a bunch of Raspberry PI's, not all running at the same time. Due to my experimental nature, there are about 3 running constantly, the others are for experimentation purposes.  
The cost of the HP EliteDesktop are at thie time of writing (late 2023) is about `$140` AU off Ebay. The Raspberry Pi's I buy new, I have a few Pi3, 4 and one 5.  

## What services do I run?  
- Nextcloud
- PiHole with Pivpn
- Home Assistant
- lxd(Incus)
- Docker
  - Traefik
  - Mealie
  - Paperless-ngx
  - Ngix
  - Freshrss
  - Linkding
  - Photoprism

## What OS am I using?
For servers it is predominantly Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, on some Raspberry pi devices it is Raspbian.
